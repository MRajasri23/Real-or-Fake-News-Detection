# üì∞ Real or Fake News Detection using LSTM

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting whether a news article is **real or fake** using a deep learning model based on **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks. With the increasing spread of misinformation, it is crucial to have intelligent systems that can automatically verify the credibility of news content.

## Introduction
Fake news is deliberately misleading or false information presented as news. With the rise of social media and online platforms, fake news spreads faster than ever, causing misinformation, confusion, and real-world consequences.

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a deep learning approach using LSTM to classify news articles as *real* or *fake*. LSTMs are highly effective in processing sequential data like text, making them suitable for this task.

## üéØ Objective
- Classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their textual content.
- Use an LSTM-based neural network for sequence modeling.
- Improve accuracy over traditional machine learning methods.

---

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Clean and preprocess raw text data
- Tokenization and padding for deep learning input
- LSTM model for text classification
